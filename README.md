I am a Business Administration & Design major at Northeastern University. I am pursuing concentrations in Fintech, Interaction Design, and Entrepreneurial Startups, as well as a minor in Computer Science. I am passionate about User Experience (UX) and many aspects of Business Entrepreneurship, including finance & business analysis.  For fun, I enjoy photography & skiing.

Check out some examples of my professional, student, and photography work.
